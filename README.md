## Work Experience

**Front-end Developer** at T10 - 2022 - Today

> My role in the company is to contribute to the success of several projects in which I am allocated, using different technologies and working with different clients and teams. I gained experience in languages like C# with .NET and frameworks like React with NextJS, Redux and Jest. I learned about different processes, design standards and documentation to ensure projects are delivered with quality and on time.

**Front-end Developer** at R8 - 2019 - 2022

> I started my journey creating WordPress websites, something I had been doing for a few years. Over time, I started to develop websites for e-commerce platforms using Twig and, later, I trained other people to help me with the development part.

> Then I took on a broader role, helping with project management, improving my communication, attending meetings, negotiating with clients and managing projects. I believe that this evolution in my career has been of great value for the company and for my own professional growth.

**Front-end Developer** at To be - 2016 - 2018

> As a Junior Developer at the company, my initial role was focused on the static part of the website development, using basic technologies such as HTML, (S)CSS or SASS, Javascript and jQuery. Over time, I improved and started to develop sites in Wordpress using PHP. My goal is always to deliver quality work, with attention to detail, I learned a lot about UI & UX, and microinteractions.
